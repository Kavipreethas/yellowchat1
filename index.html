<b>Do’s & Don’ts while using Weather Plus:</b><br>

<h1><b>Do’s:</b></h1>

<br>1)	Get the house designed from certified RCC consultant.<br> 
<br>2)	Ensure reinforcement placement as per the RCC design.<br>
<br>3)	Ensure that the shuttering is firm & leakproof to avoid leakage of cement slurry during concreting.<br>
<br>4)	It is always better to go with weigh batching rather than volume batching. In any case ensure appropriate batching of concrete to ensure cohesive & workable concrete without segregation <br>
<br>5)	Use sand/M sand with lesser fines or silt content.<br>
<br>6)	Mixing water has to be always measured using a fixed measuring container in order to avoid any mistakes.<br>
<br>7)	First uniformly mix cement with aggregates in mixer in dry state. Once its mixed, add the predetermined water.<br> 
<br>8)	During concrete mixing, addition of water must be done in regular intervals and not in a single stretch.<br> 
<br>9)	Always mix the concrete for at least 2/3 minutes after addition of total water in order to ensure homogeneity of the mix.<br>
<br>10)	Use of water reducing admixtures/plasticisers is advisable to ensure adequate concrete workability without addition of excess water <br>
<br>11)	The concrete should always be placed, compacted & finished as early as possible after addition of water, before the initial setting / stiffening of concrete. <br>
<br>12)	Finish the concrete surface and edges using trowels or wooden floats or metal floats. Ensure that the concrete is finished in unidirectional manner.<br>
<br>13)	Compact concrete adequately using vibrator <br>
<br>14)	The fresh concrete should be protected from direct sunrays and strong winds for at least 24 hours<br>
<br>15)	Always pour the concrete in favourable weather conditions. During hot summer season, wherever feasible, carry out the concreting works during early hours of the day or late in the evening to avoid exposure to harsh climatic conditions<br>
<br>16)	In hot weather, Keep the aggregates under shade, lower the temperature of the fresh concrete by using chilled mixing water or replacing some of this water with crushed ice<br>
<br>17)	Cover the freshly placed concrete with tarpaulins or plastic sheet to prevent evaporation of bleed water. Start curing as soon as possible after placing of concrete but before the surface water-sheen fully disappears.<br>
<br>18)	If construction is done on areas where wind velocity is higher, ensure to use wind cutters in order to avoid rapid drying of the surface moisture in fresh concrete.<br>
<br>19)	Provide proper slop to the terrace slab to ensure that the rainwater is drained off as quickly as possible and there is no stagnation of water on slab<br>

<h1> <b>Don'ts </b></h1>

<br>1)	Do not allow rapid drying of fresh concrete.<br>
<br>2)	Avoid formation of any kind of cold joints in the structural component.<br>
<br>3)	Never sprinkle dry cement on top of the concrete surface while finishing.<br>
<br>4)	Avoid excessive vibrations/compaction of concrete <br>
<br>5)	Do not use damaged or leaky formworks <br>
<br>6)	Do not drop concrete from greater height, since there are chances of segregation by doing so.<br>
<br>7)	Don’t vibrate the concrete once it has started hardening.<br>
<br>8)	Avoid slab concrete work in hot & windy climatic conditions. <br>
<br>9)	Avoid over-finishing of concrete surface<br>
<br>10)	Don’t add excess water during concrete mixing to attain desired workability, it may cause segregation<br>
